# This workflow will install Python dependencies, pre-commit checks, run tests and generate Coverage report
# Not caching pip dependencies in this runner to catch breaking changes in unpinned dependencies
# Fixing OS version to avoid breaking OS changes during development stage.
# Will open up OS versions before release.
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
