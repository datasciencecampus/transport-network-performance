# This workflow will install OS dependencies and run a 'base' set of unit tests with Python 3.9
# The base set is selected based on dependencies that have previously caused issues on Windows
# Will look to open up the windows test suite in the future.
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
