# `override` variable in the sections below can be used to skip over stages
# which take some time to execute. When running for the first time, it is
# necessary to set these variables to `true` so that the intermediate and
# processed data sources can be built. Afterwards, feel free to set these to
# `false` to avoid rebuilding 'expensive' processed inputs.
# Use the `write_outputs` flags below to control whether or not to write
# geneerated outputs to file (useful if you do not want to overwrite results).
