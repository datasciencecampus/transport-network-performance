# `data` folder overview

Any data that needs to be stored locally should be saved in this location. This folder,
and its sub-folders, are not version-controlled.

The sub-folders should be used as follows:

- `external`: any data that will not be processed at all, such as reference data;
- `raw`: any raw data before any processing;
- `interim`: any raw data that has been partially processed and, for whatever reason,
  needs to be stored before further processing is completed; and
- `processed`: any raw or interim data that has been fully processed into its final
  state.
